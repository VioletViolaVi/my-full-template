Welcome VioletViolaVi,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project.

Gitpod Reminders
To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

python3 -m http.server

A blue button should appear to click: Make Public,

Another blue button should appear to click: Open Browser.

To run a backend Python file, type python3 app.py, if your Python file is named app.py of course.

A blue button should appear to click: Make Public,

Another blue button should appear to click: Open Browser.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the sudo (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

Updates Since The Instructional Video
We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

February 2020: The initialisation files now do not auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

December 2019: Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type !bscdn in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the README.md file at the official repo for more options.

Happy coding!
